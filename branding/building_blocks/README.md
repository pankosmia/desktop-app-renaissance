Logos etc for Panskosmia-related projects

## This folder (`building blocks`)
This folder is a container housing subdirectorees for building block images created and used by scripts in it's parent directory (`branding`).

With respect to uploading these files to a public github repo, delete them after running those scrips if you do not want to do that. However, consider that the icon.icns distributed with your app will contain a 1024px x 1024px version of the log you use for this icon. So, anyone interesting in a high resolution of your icon will already have easy access that one.
