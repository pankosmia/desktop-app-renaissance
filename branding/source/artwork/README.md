## This folder (`artwork`)
This folder is an optional container to house files used in preparing the three filed placed in it's parent directory (`source`).

With respect to uploading these files to a public github repo, keep them outside of this project if you do not want to do that. However, consider that the icon.icns distributed with your app will contain a 1024px x 1024px version of the log you use for this icon. So, anyone interesting in a high resolution of your icon will already have easy access that one.

## New Forks from Desktop-App-Template
If this project is a fork from desktop-app-template, then this folder will initially contain artwork from that project. You can delete any artwork files from this folder that are not applicable to your project.
