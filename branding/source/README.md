Logos etc for Panskosmia-related projects

## This folder (`source`)
This folder is a container to house source images needed by scripts in it's parent directory (`branding`).

With respect to uploading these files to a public github repo, delete them after running those scrips if you do not want to do that. However, consider that the icon.icns distributed with your app will contain a 1024px x 1024px version of the log you use for this icon. So, anyone interesting in a high resolution of your icon will already have easy access that one.

## Source Images <sub><sup>... [â†©](#toc)</sup></sub>
Three source images are required. Place these images in the `source` subdirecftory of `branding`:
- favicon_1024x1024.png
- mac_icon_1024x1024.png
  - Transparent margins, with a solid inner square background with rounded corners.
- win_icon_1024x1024.png
  - Small transparent margin, with solid inner background optional.

## New Forks from Desktop-App-Template
If this project is a fork from desktop-app-template, then this folder will initially contain source images from that project. Replace them with source images applicable to your project.
